### Key Points
> Original idea too complex.

> Took a step back, simplified things. Created a new project keeping it as basic as possible

> Incremental steps, one basic function at a time. Perfect that function and progress forward.

> Added tests for validations and had to constantly update fixtures when changing things, especially with devise.

> Fell in love with boot strap.

> Most challenging part was S3 bucket for heroku.


## Problem
> Students like those enrolled in coder factory academy that need access to reputable quality programming books at a low cost. This problem was really put in to perspective when myself and another cfa student were looking up Rails programming books, with some being as much as $91! This is from fishpond, the cheapest source for books like these I have found online.

## Solution
### BookBuy!!!!

> I developed a two sided marketplace where students like myself and my classmates can sell their books or buy another students for a low price!

### How does it work you ask?
> Well before a user can do anything they must sign up with valid credentials, because without a confirmable email, the user can not use the site. After confirmation, users are free to create as many listings of their books as they want! Likewise, users looking to buy can purchase as many listings as they want.
