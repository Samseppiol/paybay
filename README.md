# Documentation

### Key Points
> Original idea too complex.

> Took a step back, simplified things. Created a new project keeping it as basic as possible

> Incremental steps, one basic function at a time. Perfect that function and progress forward.

> Added tests for validations and had to constantly update fixtures when changing things, especially with devise.

> Fell in love with boot strap.

> Most challenging part was S3 bucket for heroku.


## Problem
> Students like those enrolled in coder factory academy that need access to reputable quality programming books at a low cost. This problem was really put in to perspective when myself and another cfa student were looking up Rails programming books, with some being as much as $91!
