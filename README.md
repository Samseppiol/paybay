# README

> Original idea too complex.

> Took a step back, simplified things. Created a new project keeping it as basic as possible

> Incremental steps, one basic function at a time.

> Added tests for validations and had to constantly update fixtures when changing things

> Fell in love with boot strap.

> Most challenging part was S3 bucket for heroku.
